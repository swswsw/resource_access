## Abstract

We propose a new mechanism that allows services to get recurring revenue without user paying.  The revenue usually comes from monetary supply increase of the cryptocurrencies, but not always.  Users stake cryptocurrency and the staking rewards become revenue for the services (website, app, content provider, offline service, etc).  This mechanism have the opportunity of bringing more mainstream adoption as it brings a novel integration of cryptocurrency ecosystem into a larger generic industries.

## Introductions

## Payment-Free Revenue

What if you can get services without paying.  What if the service can still get recurring revenue without users paying.  That is what we are tackling.  This seemingly impossible problem has a novel solution that is only possible due to the advent of the staking cryptocurrencies.

Users stake cryptocurrencies.  Staking generates staking rewards.  These staking rewards usually comes from monetary supply increase as these cryptocurrencies mint new tokens.  The staking rewards become a new revenue source for the service.  

## Terminology

I used the term "staking" in generic way to cover several concepts.  For example, on Stellar, you can vote for inflation to get inflation tokens.  Which does not use the term "stake".  I also use the term staking rewards in generic way to cover several concepts that earns rewards.  On EOS, block producer gets block rewards, which can be used as revenue for the .  Dash also has different concept of getting some type of rewards.  

## Pain of Paying

When people pay, they consciously or subconsciously does a mental accounting to justify it.  There is a pain of paying because people are loss-averse (Zellermayer, 1996) (https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/pain-of-paying/).  This is very important concept that regulate one's spending.  This is also why it is so difficult to convert free users to paying users.  

This paper proposes a mechanism that will hopefully reduce or eliminate "pain of paying" from userss.


## Backgrounds

During the early years of cryptocurrency, we believed payment was the killer app.  We believed that is the the thing that will bring mass adoption.  There were a number of players in crypto payment ecosystem.  For example, both Bitpay and Coinbase provide merchant solutions.

Payment turned out to be difficult to crack due to networking effect within the system.  for example, it is very difficult to change the last-mile point-of-sale devices to accept new payment.  Integration and training could all take a lot of work.

Moreover, cryptocurrency users often expect the cryptocurrency to raise in value, which makes holding easier than paying.  and this increase the pain-of-paying.

GoldenPass's unique new model may fit cryptocurrency owners mindset better than paying.  This model allows them to increase the network activity while keeping their stack.  Mentally, this reconcils the activity of obtaining service with their expectation of rising values.

A number of cryptocurrencies have come online with monetary supply increase, such as Tezos, Cosmos, EOS, etc.  Need more economic activities to sustain the inflation.


## Benefits

### To Site/App, Content Providers, and Service Providers

There are multitudes of benefits to site/app, content providers (eg. Youtube video uploader or Instagram models), and other digital/non-digital service providers.  There are two primary benefits.  

First, this is a new revenue stream.  This is a new kind of revenue that does not exist before.  Many site/apps have been relying on either ad or direct payments as revenue.  They now have a new revenue possibility besides those traditional revenue.  Second and more importantly, this removes the "pain of paying" from service providers' users. 

There are also other benefits.  For example, this revenue can work globally, unlike payment.  Payment are often regional.  For example, many Chinese websites only takes payment that is difficult to access for non-Chinese.

### To Users

Users receive services and contents without paying.  It is worthwhile to note that the user can get back their stake in entirety after the locking period.

### To Crypto Owners

More usage on the network could result in price increase.  More staking means decreased circulation of tokens as every staked tokens are taken off circulation until the staked period end.  Decreased circulation means decreased supply.  Thus, the price could increase as a result of decreased supply.

### Win-Win-Win Situation

This is a win-win-win situation for site/app owners, regular users, and the cryptocurrency networks.  

## Why This is not Available Before

A number of people may ask: this sounds like a great concept, why is this not available before?  This mechanism is nearly impossible before the advent of staking cryptocurrency with monetary supply increase.  Major staking cryptocurrencies that satisfies this mechanism includes Tezos, Cosmos, and EOS, etc.  Tezos and EOS mainnet are launched at the later half of 2018.  Cosmos mainnet launched at April 2019.  

## Cryptocurrencies Networks

For this mechanism to work, the cryptocurrencies networks need to satisfy the following: 1. have staking.  2. have monetary supply increase.  Many cryptocurrencies satisfies these criteria, including but not exclusive to, Tezos, Cosmos, EOS, Polkadot, Algorand, ThunderToken, etc.  Stellar has monetary supply increase (called "inflation" in Stellar), but not staking.  However, Stellar has a way to delegate (vote) the inflation to another party to aggregate the inflation (often called "inflation pool").  Thus Stellar will work for this mechanism as well.

## Issues

### Doing More Work Than a Validator

One of the most common criticisms of this approach is why doesn't GoldenPass simply be a validator.  A validator's work is a subset of GoldenPass'.  GoldenPass does a lot more work, but may have less financial gain than a validator.  While this may be true, someone in the ecosystem has to do this for ecosystem diversity and to include more users into this system.  At the moment of writing, the validator scenes in general are quite homogeneous.  Almost all players are doing validation for the same purpose of financial returns.  We need some other type of players to introduce some heterogenity into the system.  More importantly, we want to be able to attract different types of users into the system.  Right now, many POS system have no problem attracting investors who are there for the financial returns, but not much of other type of users.  With GoldenPass, users have more reasons to use the crypto system other than to gain staking interest.  This may attract regular users who wishes to use regular services into the system.

I want to point out that for a cryptocurrency that mint 5-10% more tokens annually, it must have economic activity to sustain the price.  Otherwise, there would be massive inflation (decrease in purchase power or the token price will drop).  Just stake tokens to get financial return is not enough.  We feel that we need to do something that will create a virtous cycle for the cryptocurrency system.  This proposal is what we think will help the entire system.

### Making More People Join Staking, Especially People Who Normally Would Not Stake

I really feel this is a good thing, and not an issue.  Some people feel that this mechanism would compel people to join stake, even those people who normally feel no urge to stake.  Some current stakers look at this negatively.  From current stakers' point of view, these new stakers compete with the current stakers and reduce the current stakers' return.  In some of the cryptocurrency systems, the amount of rewards are proportional to their quantity of staking.  The stakers share the total rewards, which is fixed.  If the total amount of stakes increases, the current stakers will earn less.  

Again, I want to say this is actually a good thing to have more stakers.  As a staker for a cryptocurrency, it is in your best interest that there are more use of that cryptocurrency.  Increased usage of the system will likely lead to increase in price, which benefits all cryptocurrency owners.  Moreover, staking locks up the fund and reduces circulation.  Reduce supply also likely lead to price increase.
