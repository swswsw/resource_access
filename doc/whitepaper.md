## Payment-Free Revenue

## Pain of Paying

## Backgrounds

A number of cryptocurrencies have come online with staking rewards.  eg.

payment was the hopeful killer app.  or the thing that will bring mass adoption.  players: bitpay.  coinbase provides merchant solutions.

payment tis difficult to crack due to networking effect within the system.  for example, it is very difficult to change the last-mile point-of-sale devices to accept new payment.  Integration, staff training, could all take a lot of work.

Moreover, cryptocurrency users often expect the cryptocurrency to raise in value, which makes holding easier than paying.  

Need more economic activities to sustain the inflation.

this new model may fit cryptocurrency owner mindset.  allowing them to increase the network activity while reconciling the activity with their expectation of rising values.

## Benefits

### To Site/App, Content Providers, and Service Providers

There are multitudes of benefits to site/app, content providers (eg. Youtube video uploader or Instagram models), and other digital/non-digital service providers.  There are two primary benefits.  

First, this is a new revenue stream.  This is a new kind of revenue that does not exist before.  Many site/apps have been relying on either ad or direct payments as revenue.  They now have a new revenue possibility besides those traditional revenue.  Second and more importantly, this removes the "pain of paying" from service providers' users. 

### To Users

Users receive services and contents without paying.  It is worthwhile to note that the user can get back their stake in entirety after the locking period.

### To Crypto Owners

More usage on the network could result in price increase.  More staking means decreased circulation of tokens as every staked tokens are taken off circulation until the staked period end.  Decreased circulation means decreased supply.  Thus, the price could increase as a result of decreased supply.

### Win-Win-Win Situation

This is a win-win-win situation for site/app owners, regular users, and the cryptocurrency networks.  

## Why This is not Available Before

A number of people may ask: this sounds like a great concept, why is this not available before?  This mechanism is nearly impossible before the advent of staking cryptocurrency with monetary supply increase.  Major staking cryptocurrencies that satisfies this mechanism includes Tezos, Cosmos, and EOS, etc.  Tezos and EOS mainnet are launched at the later half of 2018.  Cosmos mainnet launched at April 2019.  

## Cryptocurrencies Networks

For this mechanism to work, the cryptocurrencies networks need to satisfy the following: 1. have staking.  2. have monetary supply increase.  Many cryptocurrencies satisfies these criteria, including but not exclusive to, Tezos, Cosmos, EOS, Polkadot, Algorand, ThunderToken, etc.  Stellar has monetary supply increase (called "inflation" in Stellar), but not staking.  However, Stellar has a way to delegate (vote) the inflation to another party to aggregate the inflation (often called "inflation pool").  Thus Stellar will work for this mechanism as well.
